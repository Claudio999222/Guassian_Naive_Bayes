# Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the application of Gaussian Naive Bayes, a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. Gaussian Naive Bayes is particularly useful for making predictions based on features that follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution. The algorithm calculates the posterior probability of an instance belonging to a class given its feature vector.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Naive Bayes Algorithm**: This algorithm is based on Bayes' theorem, which calculates the probability of a hypothesis given the observed evidence. In the context of classification, it estimates the probability of a class given the features of an instance.

2. **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Specifically designed for continuous features that are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. It models the distribution of each class as a Gaussian (normal) distribution.

3. **Assumption of Independence**: The "naive" assumption in Naive Bayes is that features are conditionally independent given the class. Despite its simplicity, this assumption often works well in practice.

## Application:

- **Probabilistic Classification**: Gaussian Naive Bayes is commonly used for classification tasks, especially when dealing with continuous features that can be modeled with a Gaussian distribution.

- **Real-world Scenarios**: The algorithm is suitable for scenarios where the underlying data distribution aligns with the Gaussian assumption.

- **Text Classification and Spam Filtering**: Gaussian Naive Bayes has been successfully applied in natural language processing tasks, such as text classification and spam filtering.

## Demonstration:

In this notebook, I implement the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm and showcase its application on a dataset with continuous features. The example demonstrates how the algorithm estimates class probabilities and makes predictions based on observed feature values.

This demonstration provides insights into the simplicity and effectiveness of Gaussian Naive Bayes, making it a valuable tool in various classification scenarios. It serves as a foundational introduction to probabilistic classification and highlights the algorithm's practical utility in real-wor
